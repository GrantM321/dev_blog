In class we are required to command a drone through a course, we are using javascript to do this. My group uses a Kanban board to keep track of what we have to work on, what should take priority next, what is currently being worked on, and what has been accomplished. 
The task we worked on was understanding the course and making sure we are able to command the drone easily. I then looked at another repository for inspiration, and I and going to put an exhanger and a constant file to make it easier. Another group member made a file in the lib with all of the commands that the drone can recieve, and we will call the exchanger to send a certain command. The exchanger will make sure that the drone is connected and that there are no errors, then it will send the commands we call. 
I am happy with how much progress we are making, and I think I am understanding it more and more as I look through the code and type it out. We still have quite a bit to do though.
