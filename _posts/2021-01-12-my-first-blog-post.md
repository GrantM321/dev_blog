Welcome to my Github blog! I will frequently blog through my time in Coding 1. I am Grant, I am taking this class to get a foothold in the carrer I want to pursue in the future. I am blogging here to document my projects throughout this class. This will help me look at how I have improved over time in this class

This is the link to my slide deck which introduces myself: grantm321.github.io/about-me-slide/


In this class I hope to learn how to either code a game or animate with code. I want to pursue a career with one of these types of skills. For my career I want to pursue something in game development or animation. 

In github I have learned the basics of how the site works and how it is useful for documenting things through blogs and how to set them up. It suprised me how easy it was after I took the training course and started to work on my projects.I am still trying to learn more about how to do different things with github and getting used to how it works.
