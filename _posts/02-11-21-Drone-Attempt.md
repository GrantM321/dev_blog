In this unit we are trying to communicate to a drone with UDP and control it. UDP is a way of sending data to other devices by sending the data fast and all at once. To do this, my device will require me to enter the IP of the drone. This is used to give data destinations. It works similarly to a house address. First I will enter the command I wish to send, tell it what method I would like to use, which would be UDP, and enter the IP, or destination, of the command. This destination would be the IP address of the drone. After the IP address I would put in the port of the device. The port is used to specify individual devices under a larger IP. It will then send the data to the drone and the drone will read it. If the drone successfully reads the command, it will begin to execute it.

This is what should happen. Our attempt did not go as planned. We think our data is being blocked by some firewall. We are not able to fully connect to our drone.
